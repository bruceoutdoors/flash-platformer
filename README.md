Platformer Using Citrus Engine
====================================

This platformer is called "Yun Yun Blades". It is for an assignment for my course subject [TGD3151 Game Design Fundamentals](http://fci.mmu.edu.my/subject/subjectdetails.php?sid=TGD3151).

You can fork and do whatever you please, as long as you credit me and the artists which I borrowed their work from.
